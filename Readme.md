# Flygawish Hotels Frontend
This system is about manipulating the Dom. in this project i built a multi-section page, with a dynamically updating info based on the sections of the page, to do this we used Laravel to append dynamically data to the Dom and to link the hotels info to the sections. we also created a responsive layout to use across all devices, such as modern desktops, tablets, and phone browsers.
